I'm Alex, a software engineer, mostly a game developer.

I've worked at Gaijin Entertainment and Shape Games on PC and mobile games in different roles: as a developer, team leader and a little bit as a game designer. But I consider myself as an engineer in the first place. I like doing things, working on complex and low-level systems, simulation and generation algorithms.

I've always been curious how games work. Now I'm making games, so I know how at least some of them do =). Sometimes I participate in game jams. You can try my prototypes on my [itch.io](https://net3ton.itch.io/) page.

Besides engineering I like graphic novels, drawing and sometimes traveling.

Now I'm working at Ninja Theory.
