I'm a software engineer, mostly game developer.

I worked in Gaijin Entertainment and Shape Games on PC and mobile games in different roles: lead developer, team leader, project manager and a little bit game designer. But I consider myself as an engineer in the first place. I like working on complex systems, interesting simulations and generation algorithms. I'm also interested in robotics and machine learning.

I've always been curious how games work. Now I'm making games, so I know how at least some of them do. Sometimes I participate in games jams. You can try my prototypes on my [itch.io](https://net3ton.itch.io/) page.

Besides engineering I like author's comics, drawing and sometimes traveling.
