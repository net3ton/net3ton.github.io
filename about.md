I'm Alex, a software engineer, mostly a game developer.

I've worked at Gaijin Entertainment and Shape Games on PC and mobile games in different roles: as a lead developer, team leader, project manager and a little bit as a game designer. But I consider myself as an engineer in the first place. I like working on complex systems, lowlevel stuff and interesting simulation and generation algorithms. I'm also interested in robotics and machine learning.

I've always been curious how games work. Now I'm making games, so I know how at least some of them do =). Sometimes I participate in game jams. You can try my prototypes on my [itch.io](https://net3ton.itch.io/) page.

Besides engineering I like author's comics, drawing and sometimes traveling.

Now I'm working at Ninja Theory.
